# Medical Charges Prediction Model

This project uses machine learning to predict medical insurance charges based on personal attributes. It implements a linear regression model using Python and scikit-learn, analyzes feature importance, and includes data visualizations. The model is trained on a dataset of insurance information, providing insights into factors affecting insurance pricing.

Key features:
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Linear regression model implementation
- Feature importance analysis
- Performance evaluation (RMSE, R-squared)
- Data visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn
- Residual analysis for model validation

Technologies: Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
